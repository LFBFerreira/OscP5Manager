# OscP5Manager
Proecssing library that improves the usability of the OscP5 library. When used with the TouchOSC app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexler.touchosc_a), this library allows for fast prototyping and exploration of your Processing sketch.

Features:
* easily develop custom TouchOsc interfaces with the Editor and link them to behaviours using this library
* easy matching of component names and actions
* scheduled actions triggered immediately or schedule before Draw
* easy mapping of values

The library is still in development, although it is usable. 
The examples are short, but if you have questions feel free to contact me.
